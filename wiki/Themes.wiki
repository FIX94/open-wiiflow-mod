= Introduction =

One of the main feature in WiiFlow is the ability to use a theme so that you can change the look of the application if you don't like the default one. 

= Installation =

To install a theme, you must download one or more from below and extract the configuration file and the theme folder to wiiflow\themes from the root of your SD card or USB device. To apply a theme, you have to launch WiiFlow and go to the global settings. From there, select the one you have downloaded. After you press the "B" button, the application will refresh and the theme will be applied.
