Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

apps			Contains Homebrew Channel ready files
				(see Homebrew Channel instructions below)

fceugx			Contains the directory structure required for storing
				roms and saves (see below)

------------------------------
Loading / Running the Emulator:
------------------------------

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew
Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps 
folder included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the fceugx directory structure required. See above.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
---------
You can load FCEUGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with FCEUGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that.

----------------------------
ROMS, Preferences, and Saves:
----------------------------

By default, roms are loaded from "fceugx/roms/" and saves / preferences are 
stored in "fceugx/saves/".

Wii
----------
On the Wii, you can load roms from SD card (Front SD or SD Gecko), USB, DVD,
or SMB share. Note that if you are using the Homebrew Channel, to load from 
USB, DVD, or SMB you will first have to load FCEUGX from SD, and then set 
your load method preference.

If you are planning to use your Network (LAN) to load and/or save games from 
you will need to enter in the SMB share settings you haveve setup on your 
computer via the Settings menu. You will need to enter in the SMB Share IP, 
Share Name, Share Username and Share Password.

Gamecube
------------
You can load roms from DVD or SD card. If you create a bootable 
DVD of FCEUGX you can put roms on the same DVD. You may save preferences and
game data to SD or Memory Card.

-=[ Famicom Disk System (FDS) ]=-

FCE Ultra GX supports loading FDS games. The FDS BIOS is required - put it 
in your fceugx folder, and name it disksys.rom (should be 8 KB in size).
You can switch disks using the A button (by default). The mapped button
can be changed under Controller Configuration ('Special' button).
Compatibility is limited, so check that the game in question works on 
FCEUX for Windows before asking for help. 

-=[ 3D Game Support ]=-

Supported Famicom 3D System games: 
* Highway Star
* Famicom Grand Prix II
* 3D Hot Rally
* JJ (Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2)
