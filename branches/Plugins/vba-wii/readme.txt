-=[ Loading / Running the Emulator ]=-

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew
Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder
included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the vbagx directory structure required. See above.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
--------------------------------
You can load VBAGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with VBAGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that.

If you have upgraded from a previous version, the emulator may start with a
message that your preferences have been reset. You will need to set your 
preferences how you want them.

Otherwise the emulator will start at the main menu, which is a list of game
ROMs. There is also a settings button to choose how and where to load or
save files, and to change menu settings.

Navigate the menu with the D-Pad, or the Wiimote pointer, and select options 
with the A button. Press the B button to swap between controlling a list box 
and controlling the buttons. Pressing the Home button will exit from the
main menu. You can choose what exiting will do by using the settings menu.

Click on the logo to see the credits.

When choosing a file, use left and right to go up or down a page.

Once you choose a game, the game will start. But you can get back to a menu
by pressing Home. This takes you to the in-game menu, where you can save,
load, reset, or change settings. The settings apply to all games, not just
the current one. These settings are different from the settings on the main
menu. If you are playing a Boktai game with a solar sensor, there will also
be a fifth button which lets you change the weather. The sunlight is based
on the weather, the time of day, and the angle of your Wiimote.

Saving and loading let you choose two kinds of save files. SRAM is the
normal kind of saving and loading that you have on a real gameboy. It only
saves up to the last checkpoint or savepoint in the game. Or you can save
a better way by using the emulator's special "Snapshot" feature which
saves the state of everything, exactly where you are up to. Loading a
Snapshot may erase your "SRAM (Auto)" so be careful.

From the game menu you can return to the game by pressing Home again, or by
clicking on the "Close" button in the top right. Or to quit that game and
choose a different game, click on the "Main Menu" button.

If you don't want to load ROMs from the SD card, you can go to the 
settings menu and choose where to load from. You can load from SD cards,
USB memory sticks/hard drives, DVD (if you installed DVDX), gamecube memory
cards, or from shared folders over the network (this is called SMB).

ROMs can be in ZIP files, but the ROM must be the first file in the ZIP. If
not, you will get an error. ROMs can also be in .7z files, or ordinary rom
files.

Patches can be used to colourise a monochrome gameboy game, or to translate
a game into your language, or to stop the game from needing special hardware.
Search the internet for patches. Many games have been translated by fans.
They can be in IPS or UPS format. You don't need to patch anything yourself. 
Just put the IPS or UPS file in the vbagx/roms folder along with the rom 
itself. The patch must have the same name as the rom. Patches can not be put
inside the ZIP file. If a rom is zipped, you might need to check inside the 
zip for the actual rom filename.

Colourised games still have some distortion in this version, but it is
improved from the previous version, and better than VBA-M. Some unpatched
monochrome gameboy games have built-in palettes in this emulator and will 
appear in colour.

You must not use patched versions of Boktai roms! (Except for the translation
patch for Boktai 3, which is highly recommended). The patches are for old
emulators that don't support the solar sensor. VBA GX and NO$GBA support the
solar sensor natively, and the patch will stop them from working.

You must also not use patched versions of WarioWare Twisted, Kirby's Tilt n
Tumble, or Yoshi's Universal Gravitation (Topsy Turvy). The original roms
are fully supported, and the patch will stop them from working.

-=[ Controls ]=-

See the website at http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/VBA for better control
documentation, with illustrations and tables.

The default controls are...

+ = Gameboy Start Button
- = Gameboy Select Button
Home = Show emulator's game menu

Wii Remote by itself:
Hold the Wii Remote sideways.
2 = Gameboy A Button
1 = Gameboy B Button
A = Gameboy R Button
B = Gameboy L Button

Wii Remote + Nunchuk:
Hold the Nunchuk and ignore the Wii Remote.
Z = Gameboy A Button
C = Gameboy B Button

Classic Controller:
Use the buttons as labelled.
A = Gameboy A Button
B = Gameboy B Button
R = Gameboy R Button
L = Gameboy L Button

You can configure the controls how you want from the controls menu. Different
controls will be used depending on what you have plugged into the Wii Remote.
Nunchuk means Nunchuk + Wii Remote. Gamecube controllers can
be used at the same time as Wii Remotes and all control the same player.
When configuring controls, press HOME to cancel.

But the controls you choose will be overridden for certain games if you 
choose "Match Wii Game" (or "Match Gamecube Game" on a Gamecube) and you have
the appropriate expansion plugged in. If the game does not have special Wii
controls, then the controls you chose will be used.

Gameboy and Gameboy colour games don't have L and R buttons. Those buttons
only work in Gameboy Advance games.

In addition to the controls you can configure, these other controls apply:

HOME, Escape: returns you to the emulator's game menu. Then press B to go 
to the main menu and B again to return to the game.
A+B, Spacebar, or right analog stick: fast forward
Right analog stick: zoom (if enabled)

-=[ Zelda, Match Wii Controls ]=-

Turn "Match Wii Controls" ON to use these controls.

All Zelda games use the same controls as Twilight Princess on the Wii or 
Gamecube. You can also connect a Classic Controller to use similar controls
to the Ocarina Of Time for the Virtual Console, but with the R trigger
acting as the B button and an inventory like Twilight Princess. With nothing
plugged in to the Wii Remote, your configured controls are used instead.

The Wii Zelda controls are:
===========================

Swing your Wii Remote to draw or swing your sword. Press A to put your sword
away again. The 2 handed sword can't be drawn this way, and must be drawn
manually from the items menu, but you can swing it like normal.

Shake your Nunchuk to do a spin attack.

Use the Z Button to Z-Target and to draw and use your shield. While 
Z-Targetting you will sidestep in some games. If you have a Gust Jar 
equipped instead of a shield, it will be used for Z-Targetting.

Use the A Button to perform an action, such as rolling, talking to people, 
reading signs, picking things up, throwing things, shrinking or growing, 
pulling things, etc. It will also put away your sword or shield. In Zelda 2, 
it will jump.

Use the C Button to fast forward. It was originally the camera button in
Twilight Princess.

Press the B Button to use the currently selected item. 3 other items will be
mapped to Left, Down, and Right D-Pad buttons. Swap the currently selected
item with one of those items by pressing that D-Pad button. The three slots
correspond to the first 3 slots in your inventory. In Minish Cap, the D-Pad
buttons use the item directly instead of swapping it with the B Button, and
the B Button is the same as the down button. In Minish Cap the left item is
always the Kinstones and the down and right items correspond to the B and A
slots.

Up on the D-Pad talks to Midna, or to your hat. It will take you to the save
screen in Link's Awakening, or to the secondary items screen in the Oracle
games.

The 1 Button goes to the Map screen.
The - Button goes to the Items screen.
The + Button goes to the Quest Status screen

On the Items screen, choose an item and then press either the B Button or the
D-Pad button to move it to that slot. The change may not be visible until you
go to another screen and back. In Link's Awakening you can toggle Bomb 
Arrows by choosing the bombs and pressing Z. It will rumble for a short time
when bomb arrows are deactivated, and for a long time when bomb arrows are
activated. You still need to equip the bow to use bomb arrows. In Minish Cap
you should be able to use the IR pointer function to select items.

The Gamecube controller Zelda controls are:
===========================================

B is the sword button. Use it to draw or swing your sword. Hold B for a spin
attack. Press A to put the sword away again. The 2 handed sword can't be
drawn this way, and must be selected manually from the items screen, but can
be swung with this (or any other) button.

Use the L Trigger to L-Target and to draw and use your shield. While 
L-Targetting you will sidestep in some games. If you have a Gust Jar 
equipped instead of a shield, it will be used for L-Targetting.

Use the A Button to perform an action, such as rolling, talking to people, 
reading signs, picking things up, throwing things, shrinking or growing, 
etc. It will also put away your sword or shield. In Zelda 2, it will jump.

have a bracelet or gloves to lift some objects. The bracelet or gloves will
be equipped automatically. This feature is unique to the Gamecube controller.

control in Twilight Princess.

share the B slot, except in Minish Cap where one is in the A slot. The item
that was not used last will be in the first slot in your inventory.

Up on the D-Pad takes you to the items screen.
Start takes you to the quest status screen.

The Z trigger talks to Midna, or to your hat. It will take you to the save
screen in Link's Awakening, or to the secondary items screen in the Oracle
games.

The Classic controller Zelda controls are:
==========================================

B is the sword button. Use it to draw or swing your sword. Hold B for a spin
attack. Press A to put the sword away again. The 2 handed sword can't be
drawn this way, and must be selected manually from the items screen, but can
be swung with this (or any other) button.

Use the L Trigger to L-Target and to draw and use your shield. While 
L-Targetting you will sidestep in some games. If you have a Gust Jar 
equipped instead of a shield, it will be used for L-Targetting.

Use the ZL Button to fast forward. 

Press the R Button to use the currently selected item. 3 other items will be
mapped to Left, Down, and Right on the right analog stick. They are also
mapped to ZR, Y, and X. Swap the currently selected item with one of those 
items by pressing that button or direction. The three slots correspond to 
the first 3 slots in your inventory. In Minish Cap, the D-Pad buttons use the
item directly instead of swapping it with the B Button, and the B Button is 
the same as the down button. In Minish Cap the left item is always the 
Kinstones and the down and right items correspond to the B and A slots.

+ (Start) takes you to the subscreens.
- (Select) takes you to the map or changes subscreens.

Up on the analog stick talks to Midna, or to your hat.

saved.
