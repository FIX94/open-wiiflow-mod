1.2.3
    * Added fast-seeking (bit-perfect only with mppenc 1.16 files and later, optional but safe on pre mppenc 1.16 files). Patch by Nicolas Botti

    * Added msvc project files
    * Changed mpc_reader_t structure, any specific data of the reader's

    in default implementation mpc_reader_file)
