  <h2>Memory Poking</h2>
  </p>
  <p>High-level poking will attempt to write the desired value to the underlying storage(ROM or RAM).  Normal(low-level) poking
  will go through the same write handlers as the virtual CPU operates through.  Note that high-level poking is not implemented
  for all systems.
  </p>
  <p>The format for the string to enter when poking memory(highlevel or lowlevel), is "[*]address value [size]", with values
  in brackets being optional.  Prefixing the address with a "*" will cause the address to be treated as a physical address,
  which is currently only meaningful on systems that have paging registers internal to the CPU, such as the PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16.
  </p>
  <h2>Read and Write Breakpoints</h2>
  <p>
  You may enter either a single address to break on, or a range.  Read and write breakpoints operate on logical addresses, unless you prefix the address with a "*", or the first
  address in the case of a range.<br><big><b>Exception:</b></big>  WonderSwan read/write breakpoints only operate on 20-bit physical addresses for
  the time being.  Furthermore, only the lower 8 bits of WonderSwan I/O breakpoints are considered.
  </p>
  <p>
  Multiple entries should be separated by one space character.  Examples:</p>
  <pre>
   2000-2007 4014 4015
   0000 1800 2300-23ff
   *1fe000
  </pre>
  You may also use "segment:offset" form with absolute addresses with PC Engine emulation, such as:
  <pre>
   *ff:0000-ff:03ff
  </pre>
  ...which will cause a break on any writes to the VDC, including the ST0, ST1, ST2 instructions.  Note that the offset is internally ANDed with 0x1FFF, so 0x2000 and 0x0000 would be equivalent offsets.
  <p>
  <b>WonderSwan notes:</b><br>
  Segment(16-bit):offset(16-bit) form can also be used with the WonderSwan debugger, but you still need to prefix it with a "*", even though logical address
  breakpoints aren't supported with WonderSwan emulation currently.  Also, the segment:offset pair is internally translated to a 20-bit address,
  and because segments overlap, you can get breakpoints to occur on writes with other segments than the one you specified.
  </p>
  <h3>Aux Read and Write Breakpoints</h3>
  Aux r/w breakpoints operate on secondary storage reads and writes.
