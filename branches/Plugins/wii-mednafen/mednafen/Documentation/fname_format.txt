The previous functionality of "dfmd5", filesys.*_samedir, and "snapname" settings can be obtained by manipulating the format
strings.
For example, remove the "%M" specifier to simulate setting the "dfmd5" setting to 0.  Available specifiers:

		%%	-	% symbol
		%z      -       Path separator(usage is optional, but allows for more platform-independent paths)

                %b      -       Mednafen base directory (no trailing slash)
                %d      -       Loaded file base directory("/games/nintendo/megaman.nes" -> "/games/nintendo")
                %f      -       File base("/games/nintendo/megaman.nes" -> "megaman")
                %F      -       Same as %f, but replaced with emulation module's short name with recognized multi-CD CD sets.
                %m      -       MD5 hash of the currently loaded game.
                %M      -       Empty for first evaluation per full path construction, then filled with the game's
                                MD5 hash(or the game set's MD5 hash ID for multi-CD CD sets) followed by a period.
				(Not available for the filesys.fname_snap string)

                %e      -       Loaded file extension("/games/nintendo/megaman.nes" -> ".nes")
                %s      -       Current emulation module's short name.
                %p      -       Special parameter(usually a number/numeric counter).
                %x      -       Default extension for the file type the path will be used for(extension is WITHOUT the period).
                %X      -       A merging of %p and %x(replaces the last character of %x with %p).

If the constructed path is relative, it will be prefixed by the Mednafen base directory and value of the
filesys.*_path settings automatically.  If the constructed path is absolute, this prefixing will not occur.
