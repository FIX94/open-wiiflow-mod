Building
--------

 Windows:
  Open the pcsx.dsw, and use the build command, 
  also you should set the active configuration to
  release.

 Linux:
  Open the Linux dir, and type 'make', just that,
  but maybe you'll want to edit the Makefile ie. if
  you don't have pgcc comment the line CC = pgcc to CC = gcc.

 DreamCast:
  Set the correct environment variables according to the KOS documentation.
  Change to the Dreamcast directory, and type 'make'. You will get an elf
  binary called "pcsx.elf". Convert it to a raw binary format by typing
  'sh-elf-objcopy -O binary pcsx.elf 1st.read'. After scrambling and adding
  an IP.BIN, you're ready to burn it on CD.

 Windows-mingw:
  Open the Win32 dir, Type as below.
SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin
set INCLUDE=c:\mingw\include
make

FAQ

  A - Tell me :) (linuzappz@hotmail.com).

* Q - I would like to port it to some other platform/cpu, where can i start?
  A - You should start porting the pcsx itself first (using the interpreter)
      and then if needed u will have to code plugins also.
  
* Q - I found a problem with some game, how can i debug it?

      over emuLog.txt, also you can use the LOG_STDOUT to send the logs over
	  SysPrintf (to the console).

  A - First check the Building section, if you still have problem you can 
      contact me (linuzappz@hotmail.com) and i'll try to help you.
