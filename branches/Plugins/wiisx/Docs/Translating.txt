 Translating PCSX
 ----------------

Just some small notes for translators.

PCSX translations are based on the gettext library:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext.

The main file to translate is pcsx.po located at the
'Intl' dir, note that you must place the translated
strings over the msgstr and leave untouched the msgid.

To test the translation use the 'msgfmt' utility to
convert the translated pcsx.po file to a pcsx.mo file
(ie. 'msgfmt pcsx.po -o pcsx.mo'), after translating
the file please send it to us and please ask before
translating it, maybe someone has already started it 
for your language.

Note that the subdir over the 'Langs' should be two
letters from the languages codes (see the gettext lib
documentation), ie: Italian: 'it', Spanish: 'es', and 
so on.


If you have any problems contact us and we'll try to 
help you.
