MUPEN64 version 0.0.4.11 - Debugger patch by davFr (WIP2)

Here is an intermediate release of Mupen64 with debugging functions.

Those new functions are intended to ease Mupen64 development, and
forcoming developments will tend to go further in this way.
See TODO.dbg for more details.

The "Work in Progress" status means that some functions are not totally
implemented, and lots others are just planned. Please be aware of that
before testing debugger functions.
Those new functions has currently been tested on Linux only.

to compile mupen-dbg, type:
	make -f Makefile.dbg clean
	make -f Makefile.dbg

You can still compile mupen without debugger, by typing the usual:
	make clean && make
It must be noted that the resulting file will have no slowdown compared
to mainstream source tree. See main.diff and r4300.diff to check modifications
applied to 0.0.4.11 source tree.

---------------------------------------------------------
Most important limitations:
- the "GoTo" button in Disassembly widget only goes to 0xa4000040.
  (NB: This function is not intended to modify PC value)

- MI and others are not displayed yet.

- To scroll the disassembly window is still risky. So watch out.
